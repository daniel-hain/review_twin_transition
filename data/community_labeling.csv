RA;1;Socio-Technical Transition Dynamics;"The encompassing theme focuses on the integration of technological advancements and socio-cultural shifts towards sustainability transitions. Central to this discourse is the notion of ""socio-technical regimes,"" which represent the interplay between technological systems and social institutions in determining the trajectory of sustainable development. Several papers delve into understanding these regimes, emphasizing their role in long-term transformations and their inherent inertia. A recurrent theme is the interaction of these regimes with policy mixes, innovation dynamics, and discourse to facilitate or hinder transitions. Notably, concepts like ""creative destruction"" and ""motors of innovation"" are introduced, underlining the need for policies that not only promote new sustainable innovations but also challenge the prevailing unsustainable ones. Furthermore, the role of actors, their agency, and the narratives they construct in shaping transitions are also underscored. These studies hint at the multidimensional nature of transitions, requiring a confluence of technological push, policy frameworks, discourse shifts, and grassroots initiatives. For policymakers and professionals, the research provides a comprehensive lens to understand and catalyze sustainability transitions, emphasizing the need for holistic, multi-stakeholder approaches."
RA;2;Environmental Innovation Dynamics;The focal point of the analyzed documents is the intricate dynamics governing environmental innovation (EI) within various industries, particularly in the backdrop of shifting towards a more digitized and sustainable economy. The research collectively investigates the direct and indirect influences of policies, regulations, and firms' environmental objectives on the innovation process, with a significant emphasis on understanding the drivers and potential barriers to EI, such as the crowding-out effect observed in the Italian manufacturing sector. Employing diverse methodologies like meta-regression analysis, difference-in-differences methods, and case studies, these papers aim to shed light on the complex interplay between governmental policies, firm strategies, and innovation outcomes, offering insights that could potentially guide more effective policy formulation and corporate strategies in the future. Moreover, these studies encompass various geographical contexts, including Europe and China, with implications for a broader understanding and collaboration in the global pursuit of a green and digital economy transition.
RA;3;Knowledge-driven Regional Innovation;The overarching theme in these articles revolves around the influence of knowledge proximity, coherence, and relatedness on regional innovation and economic growth. At the heart of this research is the idea that the generation and application of new knowledge, both from within a region and externally, can significantly impact regional innovation. In particular, these studies emphasize that closely related knowledge (or technology classes) can enhance regional innovation capabilities. Yet, there's also an emphasis on the benefits of diversified knowledge bases, especially in terms of radical innovation and drawing from external knowledge flows. Larger urban areas are typically associated with a broader dispersion of knowledge, while smaller ones might show greater relatedness due to limited technological capabilities. Interestingly, the spatial distribution and the dynamics of regional specialization versus diversity also play pivotal roles. The implications are manifold: policymakers and professionals should consider fostering both internal coherence and external knowledge networks to maximize regional innovation and growth.
RA;4;Industry 4.0 Integration & Sustainability;The research landscape focuses on the transition of industries toward Industry 4.0, the fourth industrial revolution marked by the integration of digital technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, cyber-physical systems, and big data. These technologies drive enhanced industrial performance, with significant emphasis on collaborative networks. A common thread among the articles is the exploration of the synergies between Industry 4.0 and sustainability, particularly from the triple bottom line perspective of economic, environmental, and social outcomes. While economic benefits are more readily achievable, environmental and social impacts require deeper consideration. This body of work provides insights for organizations, policymakers, and scholars on the strategies, challenges, and benefits of transitioning to Industry 4.0, with an eye on achieving broader sustainable development goals.
RA;5;Circular Economy Implementation;The overarching research theme revolves around the understanding and adoption of the circular economy (CE) within various industrial contexts. The core of CE lies in the regenerative use of resources, emphasizing sustainable consumption, production, and resource management. Key research directions include the development of CE frameworks, evaluation methods, and the understanding of its integration at micro, meso, and macro levels of businesses. Most articles reveal that while the concept of CE is gaining traction in academia and industries, practical implementation and systemic integration remain challenging. A substantial focus has been laid on understanding the transition from traditional linear models to circular ones, particularly in the manufacturing sector. The benefits span across economic, environmental, and societal facets. Contributions suggest the need for comprehensive managerial practices, proactive stakeholder involvement, and digital transformation as essential levers for successful CE implementation. Future research is encouraged to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical execution, including the synergy between CE and Industry 4.0.
RA;6;Incumbent Adaptation in Technological Transitions;"The overarching theme revolves around the challenges and dynamics incumbent firms face when confronted with radical technological innovations or discontinuities. Central to this research is the concept of ""creative destruction,"" where new technologies may potentially render existing ones obsolete, affecting established industry players. While some incumbent firms struggle with such disruptive transitions, others find ways to adapt, either by evolving their existing technologies, integrating new with the old, or leveraging unique competences. The research delves into factors that determine the success or decline of incumbents, such as the nature of the technological shift, the firm's inherent strengths, and strategies like R&D investments, partnerships, and organizational redesign. This field of study has profound implications for strategists and policymakers, emphasizing the importance of adaptability, innovation ecosystems, and strategic foresight in a rapidly changing technological landscape."
KB;1;Socio-Technical Transitions in Sustainability;The research corpus revolves around the socio-technical transitions towards sustainable systems, explored from a multi-level perspective.
