However, there has been little theoretical discussion of this topic. In this conceptual paper, the authors draw on literature on both sustainability transition studies and innovation studies to explore critically the contribution of digital innovation in sustainability transitions. They conceptualize transitions as fundamental changes in patterns of production and consumption, such as those relating to energy. Radical innovation leads to changes in the structure of socio-technical systems underlying such patterns, while incremental innovation contributes to maintaining the structure and current patterns. The authors suggest that digital innovations may contribute positively to sustainability transitions through couplings with sustainable innovations. They propose the following typology of such couplings: incremental twin innovations, sustainability supported digital innovations, digitally supported sustainable innovations, and radical twin innovations. Radical twin innovations may possess the greatest potential for sustainability transitions, as they are linked to structural change and thus open new pathways for sustainability transitions, whereas incremental twin innovations merely optimize current unsustainable systems. The typology is illustrated with examples from shipping and from electricity systems, and some of the complexities of twin transitions encountered by researchers and practitioners alike are discussed. © 2023 The Authors","Digitalization; Incremental innovation; Radical innovation; Socio-technical transition; Structural change; Twin transition","Sustainable development; Digital innovations; Digitalization; Fundamental changes; Incremental innovation; Innovation studies; Radical innovation; Socio-technical transitions; Structural change; Sustainability transition; Twin transition; Couplings; complexity; innovation; structural change; sustainability; technological development",,,,,,,,"Andersen, A.D., Frenken, K., Galaz, V., Kern, F., Klerkx, L., Mouthaan, M., Piscicelli, L., Vaskelainen, T., On digitalization and sustainability transitions (2021) Environ.

Using longitudinal data for the period 2006–2018, we examine the changes in green patents granted: (i) due to the implementation of various levels of stringency of environmental policies across all cities; and (ii) after the introduction of smart city policies in 2012 in China. The prior literature stresses the importance of environmental policies, yet less attention has been paid to digital policies required to drive eco-innovation and their spatial dimension in the context of a developing economy. Our results show that, when digital policies (artificial intelligence and internet of things) are implemented in cities that have adopted strict environmental policies, the production of green patents increases. We contribute to debates in the literature of policy mix for sustainability transitions in the context of a developing economy by illustrating the importance of both types of policy for eco-innovation, as they correct two market failures and, more importantly, address the systemic coordination problems that occur during the production of green patents. © 2023 The Author(s)","China; Difference-in-differences; Digital policy; Eco-innovation; Environmental policy; Smart city","artificial intelligence; developing world; environmental policy; innovation; Internet; policy implementation; smart city; sustainability; urban design; urban policy; China",,,,,"National Social Science Fund of China, NSSFC: 21BJL088","The authors would like to thank the editor of World Development for her guidance in the review process.

By considering the transformative role that AI is playing in the invention process and connecting it to the regional development of environmental technologies, we examine the relationship between green-revealed technological advantages and local AI for EU-28 (NUTS-3) regions over the period 1982–2017. Results show that AI knowledge favours the green-tech specialization of regions, provided that they were already green-tech specialized in the past.

With this in mind, this paper analyses the long run trends in energy intensity and communication intensity since 1850. The evidence indicates that these economies experienced a coevolution of energy and communication intensities during their industrialisation phase, followed by a divergence in the energy and communication intensities associated with the development of high tech and ICT. Overall, this reflects the dematerialisation of these European economies. The paper also analyses the speed of historical energy transitions and communication technology transitions in these economies, finding that communication transitions appear to be substantially faster than energy transitions. The evidence suggests that twin transitions of the decarbonisation and digitalisation of economies are likely to experience a process of imbalanced structural transformation (with ICT continuing to forge ahead). This expectation should guide policy recommendations – increasing the need for low carbon industry to develop and create synergies between the two industries in order to avoid the new industrial revolution being high‑carbon. © 2022","Energy intensity; Energy transitions; Historical; ICT; Twin transition",,,,,,"UK Research and Innovation, UKRI: EP/R 035288/1; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/R009708/1; European Commission, EC","We would like to thank Claude Diebolt, the editor, Benjamin Sovacool, and three anonymous referees for their valuable comments.

This work is aimed at contributing to this matter, with twofold goals: on the one hand, to show a depth desk-research analysis of the key existing policies at European level that foster this twin digital and green transition; on the other hand, to review practical use cases and international projects where CE practices are boosted through the implementation of KET. From the analysis, a set of recommendations are suggested as a guide for policymakers, researchers, and industry managers on how to foster the CE through the implementation of I4.0 technologies. © 2021 by the authors.

Progressively, they gained the interest of policymakers, practitioners and scholars all over the world. Even if they have been usually described as two independent research fields, there are some examples presenting overlaps between these topics, represented by hybrid categories like Circular I4.0 and Digital CE. Starting from these two perspectives, an innovative framework both highlighting the links between I4.0 and CE and unveiling future research fields has been developed. Basing on one of the two perspectives, results show as it is possible to enhance a set of different relations. Depending on a dedicated area of either CE or I4.0 it is possible to see the prevalence of some I4.0 technology than others. However, the influence of I4.0 technologies on CE is always verified. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The advent of the 4th industrial revolution has seen the increased application of digitalization in several fields and at different levels. High-tech digital devices, platforms and environments are increasingly being deployed to enhance productivity, efficiency and sustainability, and improve overall well-being of urban dwellers. Digitalization is projected to further impact cities in future, transform jobs and trigger life-style changes with far-reaching impacts that will ultimately affect cities’ resilience and adaptation capacities. While a growing body of research has highlighted the significance of digitalization to climate change mitigation such as reducing GHG and CO2 emissions, comprehensive evaluations of the potentials of digitalization as an enabler of climate change adaptation remain scarce. This paper addresses this gap by analysing the current trend in digital revolution in relation to climate change adaptation and examines the likely challenges of digitalization. A desk research method was adopted, focusing on core digitalization concepts driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0). Nine case studies in cities across various continents were selected to assess the potentials of digitalization in addressing climatic hazards and to highlight benefits from implementing digitalization, while considering the social-ecological-technological challenges and tensions around IR 4.0. Our findings reveal the capabilities of digitalization in supporting more effective early warning and emergency response systems, enhancing food and water security, improving power infrastructure performance, enabling citizen engagement and participatory adaptation measures and minimizing the impacts of climatic hazards. Finally, we recommend feasible pathways to overcome present risks and challenges in order to optimize the numerous opportunities offered by digitalization in support of climate change adaptation initiatives. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate change; Digitalization; Sustainable; Urban","Digital devices; Greenhouse gases; Hazards; Industrial research; Industry 4.0; Planning; Sustainable development; Adaptation; Climate change adaptation; Climate change mitigation; Comprehensive evaluation; Digitalization; Emergency response systems; Sustainable; Urban; Climate change",,,,,"MRF; United Nations University, UNU; United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security, UNU-EHS","The authors wish to acknowledge the United Nations University (UNU-EHS) and Munich Re Foundation (MRF) for inspiring this research through organising and hosting the Summer Academy on World Risk and Adaptation Futures 2018, in collaboration with UNFCCC.",,"AgroClimate, AgroClimate 2015 (2015), http://www.agroclimate.org/; Ahmed, F., Moors, E., Shah Alam Khan, M., Warner, J., van Scheltinga, C.T., Tipping points in adaptation to urban flooding under climate change and urban growth: The case of the Dhaka megacity (2018) Land Use Policy, 79, pp. 496-506; American Metereological Society, Explaining extreme events in 2017 from a climate perspective (2018); ARUP, and Rockefeller Foundation, City resilience and the city resilience framework: 100 resilient cities (2015); Battarra, R., Zucaro, F., Tremiterra, M.R., Smart mobility and elderly people.
