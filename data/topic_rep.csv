and (2) the rules generated from conventional statistical methods (i.e., arima), and artificial intelligence technologies (i.e., support vector machines (svm) and artificial neural networks (ann)) are not easily comprehensive for policy-maker. based on these reasons above, this paper proposes a new model, which incorporates one step-ahead concept into adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (anfis) to build a fusion anfis model and enhances forecasting for electricity loads by adaptive forecasting equation. the fuzzy if-then rules produced from fusion anfis model, which can be understood for human recognition, and the adaptive network in fusion anfis model can deal with the nonlinear relationships. this study optimizes the proposed model by adaptive network and adaptive forecasting equation to improve electricity loads forecasting accuracy. to evaluate forecasting performances, six different models are used as comparison models. the experimental results indicate that the proposed model is superior to the listing models in terms of mean absolute percentage errors (mape).', 'a hybrid annual power load forecasting model based on generalized regression neural network with fruit fly optimization algorithm. accurate annual power load forecasting can provide reliable guidance for power grid operation and power construction planning, which is also important for the sustainable development of electric power industry. the annual power load forecasting is a non-linear problem because the load curve shows a non-linear characteristic. generalized regression neural network (grnn) has been proven to be effective in dealing with the non-linear problems, but it is very regretfully finds that the grnn have rarely been applied to the annual power load forecasting. therefore, the grnn was used for annual power load forecasting in this paper. however, how to determine the appropriate spread parameter in using the grnn for power load forecasting is a key point. in this paper, a hybrid annual power load forecasting model combining fruit fly optimization algorithm (foa) and generalized regression neural network was proposed to solve this problem, where the foa was used to automatically select the appropriate spread parameter value for the grnn power load forecasting model. the effectiveness of this proposed hybrid model was proved by two experiment simulations, which both show that the proposed hybrid model outperforms the grnn model with default parameter, grnn model with particle swarm optimization (psogrnn), least squares support vector machine with simulated annealing algorithm (salssvm), and the ordinary least squares linear regression (ols-lr) forecasting models in the annual power load forecasting.']"

cities increasingly engage in climate adaptation planning, many are seeking to promote public participation and facilitate the engagement of different civil society actors. still, the variations that exist among participatory approaches and the merits and tradeoffs associated with each are not well understood. this article examines the experiences of quito (ecuador) and surat (india) to assess how civil society actors contribute to adaptation planning and implementation. the results showcase two distinct approaches to public engagement. the first emphasizes participation of experts, affected communities, and a wide array of citizens to sustain broadly inclusive programmes that incorporate local needs and concerns into adaptation processes and outcomes. the second approach focuses on building targeted partnerships between key government, private, and civil society actors to institutionalize robust decision-making structures, enhance abilities to raise funds, and increase means to directly engage with local community and international actors. a critical analysis of these approaches suggests more inclusive planning processes correspond to higher climate equity and justice outcomes in the short term, but the results also indicate that an emphasis on building dedicated multi-sector governance institutions may enhance long-term programme stability, while ensuring that diverse civil society actors have an ongoing voice in climate adaptation planning and implementation. policy relevance many local governments in the global south experience severe capacity and resource constraints. cities are often required to devolve large-scale planning and decision-making responsibilities, such as those critical to climate adaptation, to different civil society actors. as a result, there needs to be more rigorous assessments of how civil society participation contributes to the adaptation policy and planning process and what local social, political, and economic factors dictate the way cities select different approaches to public engagement. also, since social equity and justice are key indicators for determining the effectiveness and sustainability of adaptation interventions, urban adaptation plans and policies must also be designed according to local institutional strengths and civic capacities in order to account for the needs of the poor and most vulnerable. inclusivity, therefore, is critical for ensuring equitable planning processes and just adaptation outcomes.', 'how industry 4.0 technologies and open innovation can improve green innovation performance?. purpose: this study investigates the impact of industry 4.0 technologies on green innovation performance. in this relationship, the mediating role of green innovation behavior is also studied. moreover, open innovation is tested as a mediator between industry 4.0 technologies and green innovation behavior. design/methodology/approach: a quantitative research method is adopted in which a structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 217 manufacturing firms of malaysia. after collecting data, the partial least squares-structural equation modeling (pls-sem) technique is applied to analyze data and test the hypothesis of study. findings: it is found that industry 4.0 positively impacts open innovation which leads to green innovation behavior. also, the former lays positive impact on green innovation behavior which leads to improve green innovation performance. research limitations/implications: the authors conclude that industry 4.0 technologies can play an important role to improve green innovation performance of malaysian manufacturing firms by managing open innovation for green innovation behavior which further improves the green innovation performance. in this context, it is recommended that strategists and policymakers should undertake the role of open innovation and industry 4.0 technologies to promote environment-friendly innovations and to promote the green behavior in companies. the authors suggest hereby that firms should be given incentives to adopt and utilize industry 4.0 technologies and collaborative innovation interactions – as they foster a climate for sustainable green innovations (which is also a key component to achieve competitive advantage) and a growing concern nowadays. practical implications: first of all the research contributes to achieving the broader of united nations to promote sustainable innovation through green innovations. moreover, the companies can also incorporate the findings and insights of this study while devising their policies to foster green innovations. originality/value: this research has done the novel contribution by bridging the gap between open innovation approach and sustainability fields while promoting green innovations in small and medium enterprises (smes). these two research fields are rarely studied in previous studies by focusing open innovation particularly. hence, the authors suggest researchers to undertake these fields to further enhance the level of scholarship between innovation management and sustainability. also, the authors recommend considering technological orientation and technological absorptive capacity of firms to improve green innovations. the current study has investigated the smes perspective in general irrespective to their sectoral differences, thus, for future researchers the authors suggest investigating the sector-wise comparison, i.e. electrical and electronics sector, chemical sector, etc.; or service and manufacturing sector differences.', 'multi level policy mixes and industry emergence: the case of wind energy in spain. the prospect of limited access to natural resources has reignited the debate on environmental sustainability and the search for appropriate policy instruments. alternative and sustainable models of production and consumption encompass both wholly new solutions as well as modified versions of existing ones. the objective of this paper is to understand to what extent instruments designed at different levels of policy domains can be coordinated as part of an organic process. the empirical setting for our inquiry is the spanish wind energy sector, a successful trajectory in terms of both energy and specialised technology production. spain has become the first country in which wind energy was the major source of energy and the second performing european r&d energy projects. this dual acceleration in market deployment and knowledge creation is the result of multiple pathways originated by the interplay of policy instruments of different domains such as energy, industry and innovation interacting at regional, national and european level. the present paper seeks to understand the development of the policy mix underpinning the emergence of the spanish wind energy sector. our approach is mostly historical and draws on official data on energy balance, subsidies, research activity and interviews. the analysis presented here confirms that while international commitments act as a guiding force, national and regional governments play a key role in the sector development by providing market signals, financial support and mechanisms to articulate different actors and their capacities. this gives rise to distinctive implementation patterns across regions and pose important coordination challenges. on the whole the present case study provides a novel insight into the interplay between multi-level public intervention and the articulation of systemic dynamics of a new market as well as a critical reflection on the research policy challenges associated to the emergence of new sectors.']"

one of the most emergent research topics attracting significant interest by researchers as well as practitioners. many articles have been published with regards industry 4.0; however, there is no research that clearly conceptualizes industry 4.0 in the context of supply chain. this paper aims to propose the term “supply chain 4.0” together with a novel conceptual framework that captures the essence of industry 4.0 within the supply chain context. as industry 4.0 is inherently a revolution, and as revolutions are evolutionary, this research also aims to capture the evolution of supply chain 4.0 from maturity levels perspective to facilitate the formulation and development of supply chain 4.0 strategy. design/methodology/approach: following a deductive research approach and a qualitative strategy, a systematic literature review (slr) was adopted as the research method seeking to understand the relationships among supply chain, industry 4.0 and maturity levels research. the three phases of the slr process utilized are: planning, conducting and reporting. a concept-oriented technique was applied to the outputs of the slr to obtain the key constructs that would facilitate the development of the conceptual supply chain 4.0 framework. findings: the slr showed that there is limited research linking industry 4.0 to supply chain. nevertheless, it was possible to extract a set of thematic categories from the analysis of the articles which are referred to as constructs as they form the core of the conceptual supply chain 4.0 framework. these constructs are managerial and capability supporters, technology levers, processes performance requirements and strategic outcomes. each of these constructs consists of a number of elements which are referred to as “dimensions” in this research and a total of 21 dimensions were identified during the slr. the slr also demonstrated that maturity propositions for industry 4.0 are still embrionary and entirely missing in the context of supply chain. hence, this research develops and proposes a maturity levels framework that is underpinned by the core constructs of supply chain 4.0 and the corresponding dimensions. as these proposed frameworks are conceptual, this research also identifies and proposes several research directions to help fortify the supply chain 4.0 concept. research limitations/implications: this research argues that the frameworks are robust because the constructs and dimensions are grounded in the literature, thus demonstrating both theoretical and practical relevance and value. as supply chain 4.0 research is still in infancy, there is a range of open research questions suggested based on the frameworks that could serve as guides for researchers to further develop the supply chain 4.0 concept. also, practitioners can use this framework to develop better understanding of supply chain 4.0 and be able to evaluate the maturity of their organizations. as the proposed frameworks are conceptual, they require further empirical research to validate them and obtain new insights. originality/value: the slr demonstrated a clear gap in literature with regards to industry 4.0 in the context of supply chain, and also in the context of industry 4.0 maturity levels for supply chain. this research is unique as it formulates and introduces novel frameworks that close these gaps in literature. the value of this research lies in the fact that it makes significant contribution in terms of understanding of supply chain 4.0 with a clear set of constructs and dimensions that form supply chain 4.0, which provides the foundation for further work in this area.', ""the role and impact of industry 4.0 and the internet of things on the business strategy of the value chain-the case of hungary. in the era of industrial digitalization, companies are increasingly investing in tools and solutions that allow their processes, machines, employees, and even the products themselves, to be integrated into a single integrated network for data collection, data analysis, the evaluation of company development, and performance improvement. to study the impact of industry 4.0 on the company we used porter's (1985) value chain model, which is particularly useful when paying particular attention to corporate areas which have a primary role in customer value creation. since the primary impact of industry 4.0 is perceived in value-creating processes, and has so far had the greatest transformative effect in this area, the model can be considered to be appropriate. the objective of our research is to discover how companies operating in hungary interpret the phenomenon of industry 4.0, what internet of things (iot) tools they use to support their processes, and what critical issues they face during adaptation. we applied a dual methodology in our investigation: we sent an online questionnaire to manufacturing and logistical service companies to investigate the iot tools they use, and the problems they face, and received 43 answers we could evaluate. we also conducted four expert interviews with manufacturing firms to get deeper insights into the application, critical issues and development phases of iot tools. during our research, we found that the spread of real-time data across companies-given the availability of appropriate analytical tools and methods-can have a significant impact on the entire company. in the case of cps (cyber physical system), cpps and big data technologies, companies using them have been evaluated as having a higher level of logistic service, more efficient processes with their partners, improved cooperation between certain logistic functions, and higher market and financial performance and competitiveness. applying more efficient production processes, and achieving better productivity and economies of scale, might also result in increased economic sustainability. furthermore, we have found that companies have started on the path to digital evolution, and investments of this type have already begun."", 'understanding barriers to circular economy: cases from the manufacturing industry. purpose: most companies include a commitment for sustainable growth involving a switch towards the circular economy (ce) model. the purpose of this paper is to present barriers to ce adoption identified by a literature review. the paper also addresses the particular challenges faced by manufacturers by answering the research question: what are the dominant barriers faced by the manufacturing industry in moving towards a ce? design/methodology/approach: this paper presents a literature review of research identifying barriers for adopting to ce in the manufacturing sector. the literature review is followed by a case study identifying barriers to ce as seen by ten companies within manufacturing, including the gs1 global information standardisation agency used by all manufacturers. findings: the manufacturers investigated focus mostly on recycling and waste reduction. these policies have low or very low ce effect. high ce effect policies like maintenance and reuse targeting the ce ideal of no waste, are nearly non-existent. the results identified seven main barriers to the ce: (1) high start-up costs, (2) complex supply chains, (3) challenging business-to-business (b2b) cooperation, (4) lack of information on product design and production, (5) lack of technical skills, (6) quality compromise and (7) disassembly of products is time-consuming and expensive. research limitations/implications: the data come from participants in a single country, norway, although the manufacturers are multinational companies adhering to enterprise policies. practical implications: this research shows that all the companies interviewed are well aware of the growing need for their company to move towards more sustainable operations involving ce concepts. the barriers identified are explored, and the findings could guide such companies in their efforts to move to maintenance, reuse, remanufacture and recycle (m+3r) operational model. social implications: the study has found that the major barriers for implementation of ce are quality issues in recycled materials, supply chain complexities, coordination problems between companies, design and production of the product, disassembly of products and high start-up/ investment costs. originality/value: the research shows how the transition towards a ce takes place in manufacturing industries by studying the manufacturing sector.']"

of knowledge is a key driver of technological change and economic growth. significant attention has been directed to the processes of knowledge production in a spatial context, but little attention has been given to the type of knowledge produced within specific places. the objectives of the present study are to map the us technology/knowledge space, to examine the evolution of that space over the time period 1975-2005, and to investigate the character of knowledge cores within us cities. the knowledge space is based on the proximity of technology classes, utilizing measures derived from co-classification information contained in patent documents. results show that over time, patents increasingly cluster within technology classes that are located close to one another in technology space. they also reveal considerable heterogeneity in measures of technological specialization across us metropolitan areas. in general, smaller cities tend to display higher levels of knowledge relatedness, often because invention is controlled by a small number of firms with a limited range of technological know-how. larger cities generate knowledge that is more broadly dispersed across the us knowledge space. some cities maintain their technological coherence over time, the technological trajectories of others fracture and dissipate, while yet in other cities new technology cores emerge and develop. higher levels of technological relatedness (specialization) in cities are linked to faster rates of knowledge production and to distinctive trajectories of knowledge evolution.', ""schumpeterian patterns of innovation are technology-specific. this paper examines the patterns of innovative activities at the technological and country levels, using patent data for 49 technological classes in six countries (usa, japan, germany, france, united kingdom and italy). it is shown that the patterns of innovative activities differ systematically across technological classes, but are remarkably similar across countries for each technological class. in particular, two groups of technological classes are identified: 'schumpeter mark i' and 'schumpeter mark ii'. in these two groups innovative activities are structured and organized in different ways. the first represents a widening pattern: concentration of innovative activities is low, innovators are of small economic size, stability in the ranking of innovators is low and entry of new innovators is high. the second represents a deepening pattern: concentration of innovative activities is higher than in the first group, innovators are of larger economic size, stability in the ranking of innovators is greater, and entry is lower. the former group comprises mechanical technologies and traditional sectors, while the latter includes chemicals and electronics. this result suggests that technology-related factors (such as technological regimes, defined in terms of conditions of opportunity, appropriability, cumulativeness and properties of the knowledge base) play a major role in determining the specific pattern of innovative activities of a technological class across countries. within these constraints, country-specific factors introduce differences across countries in the pattern of innovative activities for a specific technological class. finally, the relationships between the specific features of the patterns of innovative activities and international technological specialization are examined. technological advantages appear in general to be linked to higher degrees of asymmetries among innovators, higher stability of the ranking of innovators, smaller economic size of the innovating firms and lower entry rates of new innovators. these relationships, however, are different in the two groups of technological classes. in schumpeter mark i (widening) technological classes, international technological specialization is associated with relatively higher degrees of asymmetries among innovators and entry of new innovators (as well as smaller firm size) while in schumpeter ii (deepening) technological classes, international technological specialization is linked to the existence of a stable but competitive core of persistent innovators."", 'creating conditions for innovative performance of science parks in europe. how manage the intellectual capital for converting knowledge into organizational action. purpose – the purpose of this paper is to discuss the concept of innovative performances for science parks as a framework for understanding how effectively human and structural capital (i.e. intellectual assets) are leveraged. the key point is fostering main determinants to investigate and/or make sense of key management activities/factors shaping the evolution and performance of knowledge creating processes.design/methodology/approach – the study was based on the quantitative and qualitative values, for the period 2000-2011, gathered from a sample of 901 public and private organizations located in the 21 european union (eu) countries.with regard to the methodology, the hypothesis testing first required an analysis of the correlations between the investigation variables, and then the use of regression analysis to study the relationships between the innovative performance of the research institutions, and the financial, organizational and knowledge characteristics of the science parks investigated.findings – the empirical research shows that: the allocation of public resources does not influence most of the selected indicators of performance, with the exception of the negative effect seen for the number of patents; the resources provided by venture capitalists have a positive effect on all of the indicators of performance of the science park; the science parks of greater dimensions have better performances; the positive impact of the systemic relationships seems to have an effect that is limited to the increase in the number of contracts stipulated with industry; the number of publications produced by researchers of the science parks seems to have an unclear effect on the innovative performance; and an increase in the number of researchers enhances the innovative performance of the science parks.research limitations/implications – it seems appropriate to suggest some research lines that arise from the limits of this work. in particular, it should be stressed that there is a need to enlarge the sample investigated to embrace local innovation systems outside the eu, so as to provide further validation to the empirical results of this research.practical implications – this research has some practical implications of notable interest at the level of european policies. interventions of public policies supporting innovation should not be concentrated on the increase of public funding but on increasing private capital investment.originality/value – this paper aims to extend literature about factors explaining the financial, organizational and cognitive performance of science parks in europe.']"
