(2) the reason why the regional porter effect does not been stimulated is that the pollution heaven effect, induced by the carbon emissions trading pilot policy, counteracts the porter effect to a certain extent.

(1) the spatial metric (specifically, the european distance) is used to measure the similarity between provinces, and sna is used to construct the spatial correlation network. the minimum spanning tree (mst) method is applied to verify the effectiveness of the construction method, and (2) the characteristics of the spatial correlation network and influencing factors are analyzed by the quadratic assignment procedure (qap). the results show the following: (1) china's low-carbon innovation exhibits a network structure of spatial correlation, and the spatial correlation network density among thirty provinces in china is as high as 0.3483; (2) spatial spillover effects decrease gradually from china's eastern provinces to the western provinces, and the western and central undeveloped manufacturing provinces mainly receive spillovers from the eastern and central manufacturing provinces; (3) the significant value of the degree of openness is 0.001, indicating that it is the primary influencing factor of the spatial correlation network of china's low-carbon innovation (the correlation degree of the obtained spatial network significantly increases as the differences in the degree of openness decrease), and the difference of foreign capital utilization and the difference in the degree of openness show a positive correlation. the major focus/achievement described in the paper is that china's manufacturing exhibit significant characteristics of regional agglomeration and central developed manufacturing provinces, and several eastern provinces exert the primary spatial spillover effect, showing disequilibrium between the eastern and western regions overall. the degree of openness is the main factor that affects the correlation network. this study provides an opportunity for the construction of a cross-regional collaborative mechanism and green innovative development of the spatial correlation network.",NA,NA

2-S2.0-84949098026,2015,"making capacity building critical: power and justice in building urban climate resilience in indonesia and thailand. a growing number of programmes and initiatives around the world are attempting to strengthen the capacities of civil society and local governments to build urban climate resilience. however, these often treat issues of power and justice in relatively unproblematic ways, without considering whether their activities will entrench existing relationships or whether they have the potential to achieve more transformative change. this paper examines the capacity strengthening initiatives undertaken in two cities within the asian cities climate change resilience network (acccrn) - bandar lampung (indonesia) and hat yai (thailand) - to assess how ideas of power and justice have been incorporated. it examines the ways in which these activities are perceived to generate particular benefits, but also explores how the process and content were defined, and the ways in which different stakeholders participated in them. by doing so, it assesses both the procedural elements of capacity building (who is involved, how they are selected) and the distributional elements (how the outcomes of capacity building programmes affect different groups). these elements of justice can be both implicit and explicit, but need to be engaged with more critically if the processes and outcomes are to contribute to more transformative patterns of urban resilience.",NA,NA
2-S2.0-84875230184,2013,"scenario-based modelling of future residential electricity demands and assessing their impact on distribution grids. new developments towards a more sustainable energy delivery system require electricity distribution grids that support distributed generation and a potential increase in electricity demand. in this article, the impact of changes in future residential use on the electricity distribution grids is assessed by using a scenario-based methodology to model residential loads. it illustrates that scenarios resulting from varied economic and demographic developments, but also driven by the focus of energy policies, can have considerable consequences on the loading and the resulting required network capacities of electricity distribution grids. a strategy for network operators to cope with these changes and optimise the utilisation of their grids is to use the possibilities to control flexible loads to reduce peak loads and shift demands. this article shows that if these loads can be managed in such way, the electricity profiles can be flattened significantly. for the case of the netherlands, the peak demands in residential areas can be reduced with 35-67% in various scenarios. load-flow analyses of medium voltage networks show that a load management strategy to reduce peak demands can realise a reduction of 21-40% for required capacity of cables and transformers. this makes a reduction 45-72% in investment costs possible.",1,0.10703040362535832
2-S2.0-84940453322,2015,"if a frog calls in the forest: bioacoustic monitoring reveals the breeding phenology of the endangered richmond range mountain frog (philoria richmondensis). amphibians are the most threatened vertebrate taxon of modern times. baseline data and affordable methods to monitor populations are absent for many australian frog species. furthermore, some species are visually cryptic, and detection often relies upon male advertisement calls. imperfect detection rates impede our ability to assess the status of populations over time. understanding the factors that influence calling is essential to inform the timing of survey effort and increase survey efficiency. automated recording systems offer considerable potential to determine calling phenology and establish the relationship between calling and abiotic factors. the mountain frogs (philoriamyobatrachidae) of the gondwana rainforests are considered susceptible to climate change impacts, such as shifts in the timing of calling. in order to describe the calling phenology of philoria richmondensis, commercially available automated recording systems were deployed at five locations, and over 5000h of sound recordings were captured and analysed. peak calling activity occurred during morning and evening periods in the austral spring. ambient temperature was found to significantly contribute to the probability of a call occurring, with the highest frequency of calls recorded occurring between 15°c and 16°c, and there was a negative relationship between precipitation and calling activity. the results allow future surveys to be better targeted and provide a benchmark with which to detect changes in calling phenology over time.",NA,NA

2-S2.0-85122375604,2022,"digital technologies can enhance climate resilience of critical infrastructure. delivering infrastructure, resilient to multiple natural hazards and climate change, is fundamental to continued economic prosperity and social coherence. this is a strategic priority of the united nations sustainable development goals (sdgs), the world bank, the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd), public policies and global initiatives. the operability and functionality of critical infrastructure are continuously challenged by multiple stressors, increasing demands and ageing, whilst their interconnectedness and dependencies pose additional challenges. emerging and disruptive digital technologies have the potential to enhance climate resilience of critical infrastructure, by providing rapid and accurate assessment of asset condition and support decision-making and adaptation. in this pursuit, it is imperative to adopt multidisciplinary roadmaps and deploy computational, communication and other digital technologies, tools and monitoring systems. nevertheless, the potential of these emerging technologies remains largely unexploited, as there is a lack of consensus, integrated approaches and legislation in support of their use. in this perspective paper, we discuss the main challenges and enablers of climate-resilient infrastructure and we identify how available roadmaps, tools and emerging digital technologies, e.g. internet of things, digital twins, point clouds, artificial intelligence, building information modelling, can be placed at the service of a safer world. we show how digital technologies will lead to infrastructure of enhanced resilience, by delivering efficient and reliable decision-making, in a proactive and/or reactive manner, prior, during and after hazard occurrences. in this respect, we discuss how emerging technologies significantly reduce the uncertainties in all phases of infrastructure resilience evaluations. thus, building climate-resilient infrastructure, aided by digital technologies, will underpin critical activities globally, contribute to net zero target and hence safeguard our societies and economies. to achieve this we set an agenda, which is aligned with the relevant sdgs and highlights the urgent need to deliver holistic and inclusive standards and legislation, supported by coordinated alliances, to fully utilise emerging digital technologies.",NA,NA
